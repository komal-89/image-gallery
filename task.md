# Image gallery

Add JavaScript to make the search box functional :

-   make sure your `HTML` is dynamic enough.
-   only filter after the user typed `3` characters.
-   filter the image in your JavaScript, don't use `CSS` to `hide` or `show`.
-   if the typed `name` doesn't exit show the user a message `No image with this title exists`.
